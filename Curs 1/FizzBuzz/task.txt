FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by 3
with "fuzz" and any number divisible by 5 with the word "buzz".

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:
1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, ...

When completed, think about how to accomplish the following:
- add a new number decoding to numbers divisible by 7 with word "Foo";
- add a new number decoding to numbers divisible by 11 with word "Bar".
